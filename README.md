## How to use the notebooks

There are several ways to use this.  One is start the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook on your laptop or university computer and open the downloaded notbook (use the "Raw" button to download the notebook). You may want to install [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) first if you are not using Linux computer.

An easier way which does not require anything installed on your computer is to click on one of the "[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fedxa/PHYS40772/)" links. This works immediately if you have a Google account.  You can make modifications to any of the notebooks and save them to your Google drive.

If you do not want to install anything, or you do not have a Google account you may use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fedxa/PHYS40772/master). It also opens the notebooks in the cloud, though it may take (much) longer to start.  Also, if you want to save an edited notebook for future use you should download it (File->Download as->Notebook) to your computer.
